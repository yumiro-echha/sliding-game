## 1. UPDATE NODE and NPM to latest version:

### This works on Windows only
Use this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In this case (during installation), Node is 16.13.2 and NPM is 8.1.2

## 2. Install React
```
npm i create-react-app
```

## 3. Create React App
```
npx create-react-app client
```
App folder is usually named *client*. But it can have any name.
Installation might take a while so drink your coffee.

## 4. Test Run your template React Project
```
cd client
npm start
```
After a few minutes, you will see in the console a link to your development server. Your browser might also be automatically directed to the development server. 
If you did not do any changes to the configuration, the dev server will be in `localhost:3000`.

## 5. Start developing!
