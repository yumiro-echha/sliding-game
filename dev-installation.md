## 1. UPDATE NODE and NPM to latest version:

### This works on Windows only
Use this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In this case (during installation), Node is 16.13.2 and NPM is 8.1.2

## 2. Install Dependencies from package.json
```
cd client
npm install
```

## 3. Test Run your template React Project
```
npm start
```
After a few minutes, you will see in the console a link to your development server. Your browser might also be automatically directed to the development server. 
If you did not do any changes to the configuration, the dev server will be in `localhost:3000`.

## 4. Start developing!
